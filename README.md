It is an efficient energy saving device built on Arduino UNO.
<b> This an energy saving device for the people who forget to turn of the aplliances(light, fans etc.) 
when they exit from their room. </b>
This project makes the use of two Infrared sensors, an Arduino UNO board, a relay module, 
breadboard power supply, a DC motor, 3 LEDs and a resistor for each LED.
The Infrared sensors are used to sense whether a person is entering inside the room or exiting from the room. 
one Infrared sensor is placed before the other. If the the first infrared sensor is triggered first an then the 
second Infrared sensor is triggered then the arduino will know that a person has entered 
and it will switch on the motor and the LEDs. If the person exits from the room then the second Infrared sensor 
will be triggered first and then the first infrared sensor will be triggered and everything will be switched off.

It also takes a record of the number of people in the room so it will nbot turn off the appliances until the number becomes 0.
